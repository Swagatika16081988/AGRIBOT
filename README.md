# AGRIBOT

I propose a solution of a chatbot that is interactive for the farmers and easy to answer their queries in an effective manner. The Workflow starts with the hello message reply by the bot and queries will be asked by farmers in which the possible solution will be listed out based on the trained dataset I give for training. We use RASA as a tool to build custom AI chatbots using Python and natural language understanding (NLU). It also allows the user to train the model and add custom actions.
